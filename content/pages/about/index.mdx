Hello!

This is the place where I will be posting my coding projects and blog articles. The topics will range from science, music, data, programming, and who knows what else:) My goal is to pick a topic, research it, and turn it into a coding project of some sorts.

My goal is to post one article a week about something I learned during that time while coding out the current project. Most of the articles will be centered around the coding of the project but there might be the occasional non coding article.
